# Explanation
We can choose between four different colours for a path line, grey, blue, green and red. Choosing a colour makes it easier for the user to read the diagram. This is especially true, if you define when which colour is used.

Applying the colour in the diagram is only one part styling. Defining a matching style for the path buttons will make improve this.

# Recommendation for colour usage and styling

## Save path (blue colour)
All paths which don't leave the step like a *save* path should use the blue colour.
```css
background-colour: rgba(7, 150, 221, 0.5);
```

## Default positive path
The default positive path, which will lead to another step or the final positive step.
```css
background-colour: rgba(154, 205, 50, 0.5);
```

## Negative path
Negative paths which will lead to another step.
```css
background-colour:rgba(222, 13, 13, 0.5);
```

## Admin paths
Admin paths, which are only visible if the Admin mode has been activated, should be distinctive. 
```css
background-colour: #fa7fff61;font-style: italic;font-weight: bolder;
```
